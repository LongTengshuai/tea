1. The dataset "1_VNIR-SWIR_spectrum_data" contained spectral data obtained separately by VNIR and SWIR cameras.

2. The dataset "2_VNIR-SWIR_full_spectrum_data" included VNIR and SWIR spectral data. These data were used to obtain the FD results in Table 1.

3. The dataset "3_IBS" contained the wavelengths of the spectral intervals selected by the IBS algorithm. The corresponding results were obtained by combining the KRR prediction model.

The result of "Amino acids" in Table 1's IBS came from "Amino_acids12_test.xlsx". 
The result of "Tea polyphenols" in Table 1's IBS came from "Tea_polyphenols34_test.xlsx".
The result of "Carotenoids" in Table 1's IBS came from "Carotenoids123_test.xlsx".
The result of "Chlorophyll b" in Table 1's IBS came from "Chlorophyll_b1234_test.xlsx".
The result of "Chlorophyll a" in Table 1's IBS came from "Chlorophyll_a123_test.xlsx".

The result of Table S1 came from the remaining xlsx files.

4. The dataset "4_IBS-CARS" contained the wavelengths of the spectral intervals selected by the IBS-CARS algorithm. The corresponding results were obtained by combining the KRR prediction model.
The result of "Amino acids" in Table 1's IBS-CARS came from "Amino_acids12_testCARSMSC.xlsx". 
The result of "Tea polyphenols" in Table 1's IBS-CARS came from "Tea_polyphenols34xiu_testMSC.xlsx". 
The result of "Carotenoids" in Table 1's IBS-CARS came from "Carotenoids123xiu_testMSC.xlsx". 
The result of "Chlorophyll b" in Table 1's IBS-CARS came from "Chlorophyll_b1234xiu_testMSC.xlsx". 
The result of "Chlorophyll a" in Table 1's IBS-CARS came from "Chlorophyll_a123xiu_testMSC.xlsx".

5. The dataset "5_IBS-CARS-Fusing" contained the wavelengths of the spectral intervals selected by the IBS-CARS-Fusing algorithm. The corresponding results were obtained by combining the KRR prediction model.
The result of "Amino acids" in Table 1's IBS-CARS-Fusing came from "Amino_acids12_rongCARS.xlsx". 
The result of "Tea polyphenols" in Table 1's IBS-CARS-Fusing came from "Tea_polyphenols34xiu_rongCARS.xlsx". 
The result of "Carotenoids" in Table 1's IBS-CARS-Fusing came from "Carotenoids123xiu_rongCARS.xlsx". 
The result of "Chlorophyll b" in Table 1's IBS-CARS-Fusing came from "Chlorophyll_b1234xiu_rongCARS.xlsx". 
The result of "Chlorophyll a" in Table 1's IBS-CARS-Fusing came from "Chlorophyll_a123xiu_rongCARS.xlsx".

6. The dataset "6_Feature_wavelengths" contains data selected by the IBS-CARS and IBS-CARS-Fusing algorithms. 
The result of Table S3 came from the dataset "6_Feature_wavelengths". 
The feature wavelengths obtained by the IBS-CARS algorithm were found in the last rows of "Amino_acids12xiu1_test.xlsx", "Carotenoids123xiu_test.xlsx", "Tea_polyphenols34xiu_test.xlsx", "Chlorophyll_a123xiu_test.xlsx", and "Chlorophyll_b1234xiu_test.xlsx". 
The feature wavelengths obtained by the IBS-CARS-Fusing algorithm were in "Feature_wavelength_CARSrong.xlsx".

7. The "VNIR" and "SWIR" data in the dataset "7_VNIR-SWIR" were used for single-camera data modeling. 
The result of Table S5 came from the "VNIR" and "SWIR" data in the dataset "7_VNIR-SWIR".

The results of Table S2, Table S4, and Table S6 were obtained directly through code modifications.
